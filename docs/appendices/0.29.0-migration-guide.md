# 0.29.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- The output of `run:detached` now uses the container name - eg. `node-js-app.run.1` - vs the container id.
- The ID of `cron` tasks is now base36-encoded instead of base64-encoded.

## Removals

- The `DOKKU_WAIT_TO_RETIRE` environment variable has been migrated to a `checks` property named `wait-to-retire` and will be ignored if set as an environment variable.
