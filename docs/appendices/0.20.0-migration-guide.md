# 0.20.0 Migration Guide

## Removals

The following commands were previously deprecated and were removed in this release.

- `apps`: Use `apps:list` instead.
- `certs`: Use `certs:report` instead.
- `certs:info`: Use `certs:report` instead.
- `checks`: Use `checks:report` instead.
- `docker-options`: Use `docker-options:report` instead.
- `domains`: Use `domains:report` instead.
- `plugin`: Use `plugin:list` instead.
- `proxy`: Use `proxy:report` instead.
- `trace`: Use `trace:on` or `trace:off` instead.
- `ps`: Use `enter` with a container ID instead to run `ps auxww` within a container.

The refactor of the proxy plugin removes the following functions from being sourced in plugins:

- `proxy#get_app_proxy_port_map()`
- `proxy#list_app_proxy_ports()`
- `proxy#filter_app_proxy_ports()`
- `proxy#add_proxy_ports()`
- `proxy#remove_proxy_ports()`
- `proxy#set_proxy_ports()`

The informal policy is to allow removal of functions within a `functions` file if they are not used in OSS plugins. Should you be affected by any such removals, please file an issue to expose the functionality via a plugin trigger.

## Deprecations

- `nginx:show-conf` has been deprecated in favor of `nginx:show-config`.
- `proxy#is_app_proxy_enabled()` is deprecated in favor of `plugn trigger proxy-is-enabled`
- `proxy#get_app_proxy_type()` is deprecated in favor of `plugn trigger proxy-type`
