# 0.21.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

The `tls` name is no longer a reserved app name, and can be used by applications. This was previously a reserved app name due to it's use as a place for global SSL certificate files; Dokku has not supported global SSL certificates for many releases, and thus there is no need to reserve the name.

## Deprecations

- `git#git_deploy_branch()` is deprecated in favor of `plugn trigger git-deploy-branch`.
