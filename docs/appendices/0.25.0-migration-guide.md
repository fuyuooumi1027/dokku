# 0.25.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- The network plugin can now set an `initial-network` for all containers on creation. This is a replacement for specifying the `--network` flag via the `docker-options` plugin. Please see the [network documentation](/docs/networking/network.md#attaching-an-app-to-a-network) for more information.
- The `dokku run` command now always removes the ephemeral container on exit. Users that need a persistent container should instead specify a `console` process type in their `Procfile` specifying an available shell (usually either `bash` or `sh`) and scale that container appropriately.

## Deprecations

- In previous versions of Dokku, the only way to specify a custom `Dockerfile` was to use the `docker-options` plugin to set the `--file` flag for a docker build. As of 0.25.0, the `builder-dockerfile:set` command should be used instead, as outlined in the [docs here](/docs/deployment/builders/dockerfiles.md#changingthe-dockerfile-location). Usage of the old method should be migrated to the new method.
- The `--rm` and ``--rm-container` flags may be specified but no longer have any effect on `dokku run`.
- The `--detach` flag is deprecated in favor of the `run:detached` command.
- The `DOKKU_SCALE` file is deprecated. Please see the [process management documentation](/docs/processes/process-management.md#manually-managing-process-scaling) for more information on it's replacement with the `formations` key of the `app.json` file.
