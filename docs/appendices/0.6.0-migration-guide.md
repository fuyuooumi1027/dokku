# 0.6.0 Migration Guide

## zero-downtime deployment
- You can now **actually** disable zero-downtime deployments per-app and per-process-type
  - Some config variables have been moved around
    - `DOKKU_CHECKS_ENABLED` has been migrated to `DOKKU_CHECKS_SKIPPED`
    - `DOKKU_CHECKS_DISABLED` is now a thing
    - The values for the above can be a comma-separated list of process-types or the literal string `_all_`
  - See the [updated `checks`](/dokku/checks-examples/) docs for more info
