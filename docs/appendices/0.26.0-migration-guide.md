# 0.26.0 Migration Guide

## Removals

- The `tags` plugin - deprecated in [0.24.0](/docs/appendices/0.24.0-migration-guide.md) - was removed. Users are highly encouraged to switch their workflows to `git:from-image`.
- The `tar` plugin - deprecated in [0.24.0](/docs/appendices/0.24.0-migration-guide.md) - was removed. Users are highly encouraged to switch their workflows to `git:from-archive`.

## Changes

- The `scheduler` plugin now controls the scheduler in use for deploys. Apps will have their `DOKKU_SCHEDULER` environment variables migrated to the scheduler plugin, after which that value will be removed from said app. Please see the [scheduler documentation](/docs/deployment/schedulers/scheduler-management.md) for more information.
- The `deploy-source` metadata from `apps:report` is now no longer computed on the fly, but hydrated at deploy time via the `deploy-source-set` trigger. This value may be empty until your next deploy.
  - Additionally, the `deploy-source` trigger has now been removed.
