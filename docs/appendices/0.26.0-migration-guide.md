# 0.25.0 Migration Guide


## Changes

- The `scheduler` plugin now controls the scheduler in use for deploys. Apps will have their `DOKKU_SCHEDULER` environment variables migrated to the scheduler plugin, after which that value will be removed from said app. Please see the [scheduler documentation](/docs/deployment/schedulers/scheduler-management.md) for more information.
