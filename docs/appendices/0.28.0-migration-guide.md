# 0.28.0 Migration Guide

## Removals

Support for the following operating systems has been removed:

- CentOS 7
- Debian 9 (Stretch)
- Fedora
- OpenSuse

Dokku will no longer provide packages for RPM based systems. Debian 9 users _may_ use new Debian packages, though support is not guaranteed.

All users are encouraged to install Dokku via the [Docker-based installation method](/docs/getting-started/install/docker.md), or switch to a supported operating system.

## Deprecations

Ubuntu 18.04 is now a deprecated installation target. The operating system will be considered EOL by Canonical in April 2023. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 or consider switching their instllation method to the [Docker-based installation method](/docs/getting-started/install/docker.md) to avoid any disruption in usage.
