# 0.30.0 Migration Guide

## Removals

- Support for [SPDY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) has been removed. No major browser supports it as of 2021. Custom `nginx.conf.sigil` templates referencing spdy-related variables will continue to build until the 1.0.0 release.
- Support for the `DOKKU_SCALE` file - deprecated in 0.25.0 - has been removed in favor of the `formations` key in the `app.json` file. Please see the [process management documentation](/docs/processes/process-management.md#manually-managing-process-scaling) for more information on how to use the `formation` key of the `app.json` file.
